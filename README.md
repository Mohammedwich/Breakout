# Breakout
2D brick breaker game made with C++. Uses the Standard library and SFML library.
Visual Studio 2015 was used to make this project.
This project is dynamically linked with SFML.
SFML version 2.5.1 was used. 
Download SFML here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
Instructions on how to set up SFML are here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/

A commit on Feb 13 2019 added the SFML files into the project folder and adjusted dependency paths with macros rather than a specific path to allow proper pathing on different machines.
